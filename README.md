These are exercises from the sixth week of Makers.

In this first module, I learned the basics of Javascript by pairing through a series of exercises, either building on previous knowledge or discovering new concepts.

#### Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Outline

### Phase One

Work through these exercises designed to train the basics of JavaScript:
* Running JavaScript
* Running files
* Variables and visibility
* Functions
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions as values
* Callbacks
* Arrays
* Objects
* Array operations
* Classes

## Phase Two

Work through challenges designed to help you learn how to use JavaScript in a real application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies on packages and remote APIs.
